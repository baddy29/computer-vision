This project's implementation is a basic background subtraction algorithm to identify moving objects in a video captured by a static camera. In this method, we compare the current frame of the video with a background image to find areas with movement.
While this approach offers the most detailed information about moving objects, it can be easily affected by changes in lighting or other unexpected events happening in the scene.
