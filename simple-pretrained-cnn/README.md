The convolutional neural net used in this project is for classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset has 10 classes namely airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 80 million tiny images with labels present in this dataset. We will be using different convolutional neural network architectures and modifying dataset on loading to test the efficiency of the convolutional neural network and draw some inferences out of that.

Following are the accuracy for both the CNNs :
