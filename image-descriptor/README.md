This project  has gone through various experimentation to identify matching points between two images regardless of their transformations. The experimented methods like feature detection, feature description and feature matching can be further used in the process image registration. Various hyperparameters are tweaked to obtain the desired results. Brightness and contrast invariance descriptor is implemented to identify feature matches regardless of intensity changes. In the end results are evaluated by tabulating TPR and FPR using three different matching strategies.
