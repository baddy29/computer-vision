This task involves finding optimal kernel size, sigma values for gaussian filter which can be helpful in generating sharper and optimal hybrid images. It has been observed that increasing the sigma and kernel size introduces more blurriness to the image, which is subsequently utilized as a filter to achieve sharper images. The optimal outcome is achieved through the combination of a low-pass filter having higher sigma and kernel size with a highpass filter having lower sigma and a medium to high kernel size.
