This project experimented 2D-color structure tensor technique to detect edges within an image. It was tested that how edges are interpreted in different channels as well as on the grayscale. Higher gaussian noise filter helped in generating tensor values which further can be used for calculating scalar edge image. This helped in identifying edges with more clarity. It was also observed that on grayscale the background edges were more prominent than foreground imageâ€™s edges.
