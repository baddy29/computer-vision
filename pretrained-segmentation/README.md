The tasks achieved in this project involved segmenting three test images using DeepLabV3. It was observed that Test4_1 and Test4_2 had better segmentation results than Test4_3. It is mainly due to the noise in Test4_3. Also, bus was not properly classified in Test4_3 because it was at the edge of the image due to which the whole object may not be properly convolved and evaluated. It was also scene that in smaller resolution of 512x512 for Test4_1 produces better segmentation results for the class “car”. Although, the results for classification for “bike” got decreased in Test4_2 when it was reduced to 512x512 image. This shows that for Test4_1 the model was able to generalize better for the smaller resolution image while for Test4_2 the smaller resolution resulted in loss of information at pixel level therefore slightly worse classification.
